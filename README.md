This is an interactive map that displays airport density by state and airports that have and do not have airport control towers - symbolized differently by telegram icon. Goal was to have a toggle like function that allowed one to switch between airports with and without control towers, but couldn't figure it out. Bo, I want to figure this out! Alas, I ended up adding the basemap switch capability, allowing the user to switch between different basemaps, taken from Leaflet documentation.  http://leafletjs.com/examples/layers-control/
